# Pages

Here's an overview of the pages that I want to include in the application:

## Dashboards
I want the time selector to have the following options:
- YTD
- Last 7 days
- Last 30 days
- Last 90 days
- Last year
- Last 2 years
- Last 5 years
- Custom time selector

Data should be aggregated by day, week, month, quarter and year, depending on the time range selected.

### Energy
I want to be able to see the energy consumption in kWh.
A selector should be available: Total, Heating, Hot Water.

Two graphs should be available:
- Energy consumption
- Energy produced

The graphs should display the temperature.

### Cost
I want to be able to see the cost of energy in €.
A selector should be available: Total, Heating, Hot Water.

## Settings

### Costs
I want to be able to set the current cost of electricity and diesel.
Cost should be in the form of a monthly table for every month that has data recorded.
I should be able to change the cost of electricity and diesel. If the price changes for a month, all the costs for that month should be updated.
Unless otherwise specified, for a new month, the cost should be the same as the previous month. The currency is €. Four decimal places are allowed.

### Application
All the connection parameters should be here.
